# HiddenBytes_Project
Hidden Bytes, an image steganography platform that uses Least Significant Bit (LSB) techniques  for hiding encrypted text within an image. The text is encrypted using Caesar Cipher, and the platform provides both the <B>  encoding </B> (hiding the text in an image) and <B> decoding </B> (retrieving the encrypted text from the image) functionalities.
